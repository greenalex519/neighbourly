##Problem Definition and Solution
---
###Problem
As all hobbyists and home DIYers can attest, finishing a project is rarely straight-foward and less so is sourcing the equipment you need. Traditional hardware stores are limited by opening hours and these often don't provide the quick fix you want for those last minute problems. In addition, purchasing tools and equipment is a costly venture and one that hardly seems justifiable for once-off uses. Your wallet suffers as does your home storage space when you've got to re-home the equipment from the store. For those renting and/or living in urban environments, the extra storage space can be hard to find and just plain impractical.


###Solution
In comes Neighbourly, the peer-to-peer tool and equipment online rental site that circumvents the hassle of buying new, costly equipment and finding a place to store it after. It is available when you are and gives you not only the power to access what you need, but a chance to connect and engage with the maker community around you.

For those with equipment lying around and gathering dust, Neighbourly provides a chance for your tools to start paying themselves off and put some money back in your pocket- for more DIY projects later!
